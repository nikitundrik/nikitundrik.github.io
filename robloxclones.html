                <p>So, if you are a tech person that is at least in 1 game that is "inspired by Roblox", you may get a similar DM:</p>
                <p><i>Hello! We are seeking a web developer for our project known as </i>(insert the Roblox clone name, possibly containing the world Brick)</p>
                <p><i>Can you make a website for us?</i></p>
                <p>- probably a kid who never touched any programming language and who looks like this: ðŸ¤“</p>
                <p>If you get a DM like this, please, do not respond to it. 75% of the projects I worked for are like this and I wasted my time on them when I could do something actually useful during this time.
                    The reason I did this is because I wanted work experience, so I could work for a real corporation (at the moment of writing this page I'm 14). Wish I would spend this time working on better projects than shitty Roblox clones.
                </p>
                <p>If you are like this, you should learn programming and focus more on the client than the website. The reason Roblox succeeded is because they got a good client developed by experienced people
                    (David and Erik did a very good physical simulator before Roblox). You <i>should</i> focus more on the client, because it's the core of your game.
                </p>
                <p>However, if you are a lazy ass, you can use the Roblox clone source I will publish soon. It's my older project, but I hope you will still find it useful.</p>
