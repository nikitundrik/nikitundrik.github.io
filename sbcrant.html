        <h1>SANDBOXES SUCK</h1>
        <p>At the time of writing this, I have already left this shitty community and encourage you to do the same.</p>
        <p>The definition of a sandbox for this post is: a game that tries to become an alternative to Roblox, but fails hilariously.</p>
        <p>So, I'd like to tell my story: In 2017, I was a Roblox obsessed kid, who, just like many other Roblox obsessed kids, complained about the current state of the game
        and wanted to play old Roblox. Then, I heard the news that a Roblox killer exists! Its name was Blox City. But, I heard the news a bit too late, because it was already "shutdown".
        Then, OMG! Blox City is getting rebranded into Brick Planet! I was hyped for this game. When the site released, I made an account and waited for the client to release with 
        huge anticipation. Then the client released! And the game was shutdown again in like 2019. Then I didn't care about it for 2 years (during this era, BP came back and then
        was shutdown multiple times), until I learned that it came back then I got bored and decided to check it out. I decided to create a combat guild there called Warriors of
        Aintia and I got allies, friends and became a "semi-celebrity" on BP. Then, this BP (omg no one could have predicted this) was shutdown again. Some BP devs then made a new
        platform called Buildaverse. I won't talk about it there, so I will time skip to July, 2022 when Brickverse (later known as Metawave) hired me as a client dev. The project
        was pretty good and the owner was great as well and... I gained fame as a client dev (or a dev in general) and was hired to work in many shitty projects. Then, I left
        this shithole and wrote this post.</p>
        <p>Judging by the text alone, you can see one of the sins of this community: constant shutdowns. After a dev makes enough money from the project, he then shutdowns it and
        after awhile reopens it to make more money. That is called an exit scam. To get list of exit scam (and other shitty) sandboxes, visit this
        <a href="https://github.com/Anomia-SBC/The-Holy-Sandbox-Blacklist/blob/main/index.md">nice page</a> on Github.</p>
        <p>Another reason on why sandboxes suck is the incompetence of their staff. To see how incompetent an owner of an average sandbox is, read this:</p>
        <p><i>I will shut down </i>[CENSORED FOR PRIVACY]<i> I know it was </i>(sic)<i> been the best platform but Enoch(1) left Cuz I was a bad manager I really want to say sorry but he didn't
        text me I know all of you loved </i>[CENSORED FOR PRIVACY]<i> but it the end and there will be no other platform until I get a client developer i am so sorry</i></p>
        <p>1 - my other internet alias</p>
        <p>Many sandbox devs suck at coding and if they don't, they usually do the following things: lying about their age to get the moderator perks, pedophilia (Brick Hill), not
        conpensating paid labor, taking advantage of actually retarded users to try to get money (Buildaverse), leaking info, because your project is still in it's planning phase
        (Sparklodia, one of the projects that I have been working on.)</p>
        <p>Also, most of the people in this community are toxic dumb kids, many of whom create a sandbox just to make their e-dick bigger and they do many things that I mentioned
        above.</p>
        <p>These are not all sins of this community, I hope there will be a Kiwi Farms thread on this community soon, so I don't have to explain everything.</p>
        <p>So, I leave this community, I encourage you to do the same, peace.</p>
