        <h1>HELLO</h1>
        <p>Hello, I'm Locke. I'm just a Russian geek who is into programming and tech.</p>
        <p>I used to be a member of the so called "Sandbox" community. In their definition, a "sandbox" is a Roblox clone (usually without an actual game and usually using a leaked
        source (but I can go with that sometimes, tbh. Fuck intellectual property!)). I used to work for some (as a Godot or Django web dev) and I also used to run a guild and even
        an entire RP universe in one (that never actually released, it's called Buildaverse). To learn more about the SBC, read <a href="sbcrant.html">my article</a>.</p>
        <p>I don't want to focus that much on negativity, so I'm going to talk about positive things now.</p>
        <p>So, I'm mostly a game and desktop developer. My favorite engine of choice is the Godot engine. Before sandboxes, I mostly did retro-styled games.</p>

        <p>My first Sandbox project was Brickverse/Metawave. The owner was pretty nice and the graphic designer was nice as well. I don't regret working for it (and their other)
        projects.</p>

        <p>I would also like to mention that I can also develop websites with Django, do Android apps using Java and also know C/C++. Oh, I also use GNU/Linux, support free software
        and I'm also against internet censorship.</p>
